Installing GDAL on linux is full of problems and issues - this has resolved some of them for me:


```
sudo apt install libpq-dev 

```

problem depedency with libpq5

```
sudo apt install libpq5=12.2-4

sudo apt install libpq-dev 
```
success!


```
sudo apt install gdal-bin
sudo apt install libgdal-dev 

```


problem with LOTS of dependencies

```
sudo apt install aptitude 

```

(aptitude can help resolve dependency problems)

```
sudo aptitude install libgdal-dev 
```

After these steps are successfull check if all 3 main libs are installed: "libpq-dev, gdal-bin, libgdal-dev":

apt list --installed | grep "gdal"


Check gdal version (should be 3.3.2 or higher if all went well):

```
gdalinfo --version
```

PYTHON
to install gdal in a python environment should now be possible:

```
poetry add gdal==3.3.0
```
Or 
```
pip install gdal==3.3.0
```
Or
```
pip install gdal==3.3.0
```
